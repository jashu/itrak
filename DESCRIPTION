Description: Set of tools for cleaning data from eye-tracking systems. This
    initial release fixes problems with pupil-dilation time series and
    includes functions for correcting signal artifacts, normalizing to a
    baseline reference period, and extracting low-frequency pupil-dilation
    signals from high-frequency noise. Future releases may expand
    functionality to address eye-gaze-direction data as well.
