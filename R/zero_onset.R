#' Zero Time Index to Event Onset
#'
#' Centers the sample index or time stamp of your time series to a reference
#' marker, such that 0 always coincides with the onset of a particular event.
#'
#' @param time Numeric vector of sample indicies or time stamps corresponding to
#' a single time series.
#'
#' @param marker Vector containing markers of trial events.
#'
#' @param onset Label in \code{marker} that indicates the onset event to which
#' the time series should be zeroed. If this label is a character string, it
#' must be enclosed in quotation marks.
#'
#' @return Numeric vector that zeroes \code{time} to the trial onset. In the
#' event that no onset marker is found, a warning is issued and a vector of
#' \code{NA}s is returned.
