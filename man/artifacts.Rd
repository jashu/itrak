\usage{
get_artifacts(ts, samp_freq, min_cont = 0.2)

fix_artifacts(ts, samp_freq, lim, baseline = NULL, max_loss = 0.5,
  max_gap = 1, min_cont = 0.2, artifacts = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{ts}{A time series, passed as a numeric vector of chronologically
ordered, positively valued observations separated by equal intervals of time.}

\item{samp_freq}{Sampling frequency in Hz.}

\item{min_cont}{Minimum continuity in seconds required between artifacts.
If the period of "good" data between two artifacts is less than this
threshold, the two artifacts are merged into one. Default value is 0.2
(200 ms).}

\item{lim}{Two-item numeric vector \code{c(neg, pos)} specifying the negative
and positive limits, respectively, of relative change from baseline
that is plausible for your time series. (See section "Advice on setting
\code{lim} argument" for more information and examples.)}

\item{baseline}{Logical vector indicating which parts of the time series
correspond to the baseline period. This is used as a reference for
determining whether values exceed the limits of relative change set in the
\code{lim} argument. If there is no \code{baseline} provided, the mean of the
entire series (excluding signal loss) will be used for this reference.}

\item{max_loss}{Maximum fraction of time series that is allowed to contain
dropped signal and/or artifacts. Default value is 0.5, meaning if more than
half of the time series consists of artifacts, \code{fix_artifacts} will not
perform interpolation/extrapolation and instead will return a vector of all
\code{NA}s.}

\item{max_gap}{Maximum gap in seconds that an artifact period is allowed to
span. Default value is 1 second, meaning if more than half of the time series
consists of artifacts, \code{fix_artifacts} will not perform
interpolation/extrapolation and instead will return a vector of all
\code{NA}s.}

\item{artifacts}{A logical vector of equal length to the time series that
provides logical indexing into which entries of the time series correspond
to artifacts. This can be obtained by first calling \code{get_artifacts}. If
not supplied by the user, then \code{fix_artifacts} will call
\code{get_artifacts} itself.}
}
\value{
\code{get_artifacts} returns a logical vector that can be used for
logical indexing into the time series to identify data artifacts.
\code{fix_artifacts} returns a copy of the time series with artifacts and
missing data replaced by interpolated values, or a copy of the time series
with all values changed to \code{NA} in the event that the artifacts are too
numerous (exceed \code{max_loss}) or too continuous (exceed \code{max_gap}).
}
\description{
\code{get_artifacts} and \code{fix_artifacts} identify and repair,
respectively, signal artifacts within a time series. They are designed to
work with pupil measurements obtained from an eye-tracking system, primarily
to identify and interpolate over eye blinks, but also any other type of
signal artifact that can appear when continuously measuring pupil diameter or
area over time.
}
\details{
Like similar algorithms, \code{get_artifacts} relies primarily on abrupt
jumps in signal to identify the onset and offset of blinks. Unlike other
algorithms, it does not require the user to prespecify threshold values that
define onsets and offsets for all time series; rather, it adaptively
determines the best values based on the distribution of the first-order
differences (velocities) of each time series. This procedure was designed to
mimic the relativistic way a human observer would visually identify an
artifact, i.e., by assessing the pattern of deviation for the candidate
artifact relative to that of its nearest neighbors.

Using the output of \code{get_artifacts}, \code{fix_artifacts} repairs
artifacts using a sequence of linear interpolation for internal artifacts
(artifacts sandwiched between good data) followed by matched lag-1
differences for external artifacts (artifacts at the start or end of a time
series).

\section{Advice on setting \code{lim} argument}{


\code{fix_artifacts} uses the \code{lim} argument to impose a floor and
ceiling to the values that the time series is allowed to take. Values that
exceed this range are then treated like any other artifact. The purpose of
the \code{lim} argument is to catch time series that contain "slow drift",
meaning the signal gradually drifts into implausible values. In setting the
\code{lim} argument, think about what sort of relative change is plausible
for your measurement. For example, if you are measuring pupils, the normal
pupil size in adults varies from a minimum diameter of about 2 mm (3 square
mm area) to a maximum diameter of about 8 mm (50 square mm area) in bright
light vs. darkness. This means if the pupil starts off at maximum dilation,
it can experience at most a 75\% decrease in diameter (95\% reduction in area). If the pupil starts off at minimum dilation, it can
experience at most a 300\% increase in diameter (1500\% increase in area).
This would correspond to \code{lim = c(-0.75, 3)} for diameter and
\code{lim = c(-0.95, 1500)} for area, but you should set your limits to be
more conservative if you do not expect your measurements to span this range.

For example, most users will measure pupils under moderate lighting
conditions, so baseline pupil readings will start off closer to the center of
their physiological range. Even assuming maximum decreases and increases from
this point, the range could be narrowed to \code{lim = c(-0.6, 0.6)} for
diameter and \code{lim = c(-0.85, 1.5)} for area. We have found that with
psychological stimuli using our eye-tracking setup, \code{lim = c(-0.5, 0.5)}
and \code{lim = c(-.75, 1.25)} appear to provide liberal coverage for
plausible changes in pupil diameter and area, respectively, and you want your
\code{lim} setting to err on the side of being too wide.
}

\section{Warning}{

If the time series contains periods of artifacts that are too long for
interpolation defined by the \code{max_gap} argument, or if the total
number of artifacts exceeds the proportion specified by the \code{max_loss}
argument, \code{fix_artifacts} will silently return a time series consisting
of all missing values so that the user can easily identify which trials need
to be dropped.
}

\section{Disclaimer}{

This algorithm is intended for the detection of artifacts in relatively short
time series corresponding to pupil-dilation measurements. It has only been
tested and validated on 6-8 second trials sampled at 60 Hz or 500 Hz. Good
artifact detection may or may not generalize to other sampling rates, trial
lengths, and types of data. Please use \code{\link{plot_artifacts}} to
inspect the performance of \code{get_artifacts} before continuing with
\code{fix_artifacts} and any subsequent data cleaning and analysis.
