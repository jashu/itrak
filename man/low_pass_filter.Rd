\title{Low-Pass Filter}
\usage{
low_pass_filter(ts, samp_freq, filter_freq = 4)
}
\arguments{
\item{ts}{A time series, passed as a vector of chronologically ordered
observations separated by equal intervals of time.}

\item{samp_freq}{Sampling frequency in Hz.}

\item{filter_freq}{Frequency of the low pass filter. The default value of
4 Hz is recommended for pupil dilation.}
}
\value{
A low-pass-filtered copy of the time series.
}
\description{
\code{low_pass_filter} implements a low-pass third-order Butterworth filter.
}
\details{
This function serves as a wrapper around \code{\link[signal]{butter}} and
\code{\link[signal]{filter}} that combines filter construction and
implementation and allows the user to specify the filter in terms of the
original sampling frequency in Hz and the desired filter in Hz, without
having to specify the filter in terms of a fraction of the Nyquist filter.

This function also simplifies the output of the call to
\code{\link[signal]{filter}} by converting it into a numerical vector,
which can then be used to replace the original time series in a data frame.
}
\section{Note}{

The low-pass filter assumes that the signal should start from 0, and it will
always return a time series that starts from 0.
